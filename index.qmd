# Course Overview

This course introduces the fundamental principles behind modern programming
language design, semantics, and implementation. Ultimately, you should come away
with the ability to apply foundational programming language ideas and techniques
to your own projects.

The course has two broad topics:

- Introduction to Semantics and Type Systems: How do we describe programming
languages? And which programs “make sense”?
- Research Applications: Students will have the opportunity to consider other
related topics of interest in the form of a course project, most often in the
form of a survey of recent research on a topic of interest.

# Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this course are programming and mathematical experience
with several different programming languages (e.g., C, ML, Java) with diverse
computational models (i.e., imperative **and** functional), which may be
satisfied by taking [CSCI
3155](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/courses/csci3155.html) or equivalent. The ideal
programming experience is experience implementing language tools, which may be
satisfied by taking an undergraduate compilers course (e.g., [CSCI
4555](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/courses/csci4555.html)). The ideal mathematical
experience is familiarity with mathematical logic and the ability to construct
rigorous proofs (in particular by structural induction). Your desire to be
exposed to this material is _very important_. 

Advanced undergraduates may consider taking this course after talking with the
instructor. 

If you have not already taken these courses or if you have any concerns, please
talk with the instructor. Proficiency in programming and mathematical logic is
absolutely expected. This means that you should be able to pick up a new
programming language with relative ease and are reasonably comfortable with
inductive thinking.
