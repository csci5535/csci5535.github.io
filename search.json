Ultimately, you should come away with the ability to apply foundational programming language ideas and techniques to your own projects.\nThe course has two broad topics:\n\nIntroduction to Semantics and Type Systems: How do we describe programming languages? And which programs “make sense”?\nResearch Applications: Students will have the opportunity to consider other related topics of interest in the form of a course project, most often in the form of a survey of recent research on a topic of interest.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThe prerequisites for this course are programming and mathematical experience with several different programming languages (e.g., C, ML, Java) with diverse computational models (i.e., imperative and functional), which may be satisfied by taking CSCI 3155 or equivalent. The ideal programming experience is experience implementing language tools, which may be satisfied by taking an undergraduate compilers course (e.g., CSCI 4555). The ideal mathematical experience is familiarity with mathematical logic and the ability to construct rigorous proofs (in particular by structural induction). Your desire to be exposed to this material is very important.\nAdvanced undergraduates may consider taking this course after talking with the instructor.\nIf you have not already taken these courses or if you have any concerns, please talk with the instructor. Proficiency in programming and mathematical logic is absolutely expected. This means that you should be able to pick up a new programming language with relative ease and are reasonably comfortable with inductive thinking."
