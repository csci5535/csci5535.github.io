The following schedule lists the topics we will cover and approximately the number of meetings we will spend on each topic. The schedule is **tentative**. Most likely, some things will change during the semester, and I will revise the schedule as necessary.

The _Reading_ column lists the assigned reading for the meeting. You should view the readings as an introduction to spark discussion in class.

The _Assignment_ column lists the due date for each assignment.
